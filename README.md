Knowledge-distilled, smaller versions of Stable Diffusion. Unofficial implementation as described in [BK-SDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15798).<br>
These distillation-trained models produce images of similar quality to the full-sized Stable-Diffusion model while being significantly faster and smaller.<br>
## Components of this Repository:
+ **[data.py](/data.py)** contains scripts to download data for training. 
+ **[trainT2I.py](/trainT2I.py)** trains the U-net using the methods described in the paper. This might need additional configuration depending on what model type you want to train (base/small/tiny),batch size, hyperparameters etc. 
The basic training code was sourced from the [Huggingface ðŸ¤— diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).<br>

## Training Details:
Knowledge-Distillation training a neural network is akin to a teacher guiding a student step-by-step (a somewhat loose example). A large teacher model is trained on large amounts of data and then a smaller model is trained on a smaller dataset, with the objective of aping the outputs of the larger model along with classical training on the dataset.<br>
For the Knowledge-Distillation training, we used [SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V4.0's](SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V4.0) U-net  as the teacher model with a subset of [recastai/LAION-art-EN-improved-captions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/recastai/LAION-art-EN-improved-captions) as training data.<br> 


The final training loss is the sum of the MSE loss between the noise predicted by the teacher U-net and the noise predicted by the student U-net, the MSE Loss between the actual added noise and the predicted noise, and the sum of MSE Losses between the predictions of the teacher and student U-nets after every block.<br>

## Usage 
```python
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
from diffusers import DPMSolverMultistepScheduler
from torch import Generator


path = 'segmind/BKSDM-Base-45K' # Path to the appropriate model-type
# Insert your prompt below.
prompt = "Faceshot Portrait of pretty young (18-year-old) Caucasian wearing a high neck sweater, (masterpiece, extremely detailed skin, photorealistic, heavy shadow, dramatic and cinematic lighting, key light, fill light), sharp focus, BREAK epicrealism"
# Insert negative prompt below. We recommend using this negative prompt for best results.
negative_prompt = "(deformed iris, deformed pupils, semi-realistic, cgi, 3d, render, sketch, cartoon, drawing, anime:1.4), text, close up, cropped, out of frame, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutilated, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation, deformed, blurry, dehydrated, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured, gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, fused fingers, too many fingers, long neck" 

torch.set_grad_enabled(False)
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True

# Below code will run on gpu, please pass cpu everywhere as the device and set 'dtype' to torch.float32 for cpu inference.
with torch.inference_mode():
    gen = Generator("cuda")
    gen.manual_seed(1674753452)
    pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(path, torch_dtype=torch.float16, safety_checker=None, requires_safety_checker=False)
    pipe.to('cuda')
    pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
    pipe.unet.to(device='cuda', dtype=torch.float16, memory_format=torch.channels_last)

    img = pipe(prompt=prompt,negative_prompt=negative_prompt, width=512, height=512, num_inference_steps=25, guidance_scale = 7, num_images_per_prompt=1, generator = gen).images[0]
    img.save("image.png")
```
