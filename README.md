Knowledge-distilled, smaller versions of Stable Diffusion. Unofficial implementation as described in [BK-SDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15798).<br>
These distillation-trained models produce images of similar quality to the full-sized Stable-Diffusion model while being significantly faster and smaller.<br>
## Components of this Repository:
+ **[data.py](/data.py)** contains scripts to download data for training. 
+ **[distill_training.py](/distill_training.py)** trains the U-net using the methods described in the paper. This might need additional configuration depending on what model type you want to train (sd_small/sd_tiny),batch size, hyperparameters etc. 
The basic training code was sourced from the [Huggingface ðŸ¤— diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).<br>
LoRA Training and Training from checkpoints can be done by simply using the standard diffusers scripts.

## Training Details:
Knowledge-Distillation training a neural network is akin to a teacher guiding a student step-by-step (a somewhat loose example). A large teacher model is trained on large amounts of data and then a smaller model is trained on a smaller dataset, with the objective of aping the outputs of the larger model along with classical training on the dataset.<br>
For the Knowledge-Distillation training, we used [SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V4.0's](SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V4.0) U-net  as the teacher model with a subset of [recastai/LAION-art-EN-improved-captions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/recastai/LAION-art-EN-improved-captions) as training data.<br> 

The final training loss is the sum of the MSE loss between the noise predicted by the teacher U-net and the noise predicted by the student U-net, the MSE Loss between the actual added noise and the predicted noise, and the sum of MSE Losses between the predictions of the teacher and student U-nets after every block.<br>
Total Loss:<br>

```python
lr = 1e-5
scheduler = "cosine"

## Usage 
```python
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
from diffusers import DPMSolverMultistepScheduler
from torch import Generator


path = 'segmind/small-sd' # Path to the appropriate model-type
# Insert your prompt below.
prompt = "Faceshot Portrait of pretty young (18-year-old) Caucasian wearing a high neck sweater, (masterpiece, extremely detailed skin, photorealistic, heavy shadow, dramatic and cinematic lighting, key light, fill light), sharp focus, BREAK epicrealism"
# Insert negative prompt below. We recommend using this negative prompt for best results.
negative_prompt = "(deformed iris, deformed pupils, semi-realistic, cgi, 3d, render, sketch, cartoon, drawing, anime:1.4), text, close up, cropped, out of frame, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutilated, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation, deformed, blurry, dehydrated, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured, gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, fused fingers, too many fingers, long neck" 

torch.set_grad_enabled(False)
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True

# Below code will run on gpu, please pass cpu everywhere as the device and set 'dtype' to torch.float32 for cpu inference.
with torch.inference_mode():
    gen = Generator("cuda")
    gen.manual_seed(1674753452)
    pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(path, torch_dtype=torch.float16, safety_checker=None, requires_safety_checker=False)
    pipe.to('cuda')
    pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
    pipe.unet.to(device='cuda', dtype=torch.float16, memory_format=torch.channels_last)

    img = pipe(prompt=prompt,negative_prompt=negative_prompt, width=512, height=512, num_inference_steps=25, guidance_scale = 7, num_images_per_prompt=1, generator = gen).images[0]
    img.save("image.png")
```
## Training the Model:
Training instructions for knowledge distillation are similar to those of the diffusers text-to-image finetuning script, apart from some extra parameters:<br>
```--distill_level```: One of "sd_small" or "sd_tiny", depending on which type of model is to be trained.<br>
```--output_weight```: A floating point number representing the amount the output-level KD loss is to be scaled by.<br>
```--feature-weight```: A floating point number representing the amount the feautre-level KD loss is to be scaled by.<br>
Also, ```snr_gamma``` has been removed.
We suggest using a standard Stable Diffusion model to distillation train, since the script has been configured for those architectures.

An example:<br>
```python
export MODEL_NAME="SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V4.0"
export DATASET_NAME="fantasyfish/laion-art"

accelerate launch --mixed_precision="fp16"  distill_training.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path=$MODEL_NAME \
  --dataset_name=$DATASET_NAME \
  --use_ema \
  --resolution=512 --center_crop --random_flip \
  --train_batch_size=1 \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps=4 \
  --gradient_checkpointing \
  --max_train_steps=15000 \
  --distill_level="sd_small"\
  --output_weight=0.5\
  --feature_weight=0.5\
  --learning_rate=1e-05 \
  --max_grad_norm=1 \
  --lr_scheduler="constant" --lr_warmup_steps=0 \
  --output_dir="sd-laion-art"
```

To train from the huggingface checkpoints, use the checkpoint_training script and just replace MODEL_NAME with "segmind/small-sd" or "segmind/tiny-sd", like so:<br>
```python
export MODEL_NAME="segmind/small-sd"
export DATASET_NAME="fantasyfish/laion-art"

accelerate launch --mixed_precision="fp16"  checkpoint_training.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path=$MODEL_NAME \
  --dataset_name=$DATASET_NAME \
  --use_ema \
  --resolution=512 --center_crop --random_flip \
  --train_batch_size=1 \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps=4 \
  --gradient_checkpointing \
  --max_train_steps=15000 \
  --learning_rate=1e-05 \
  --max_grad_norm=1 \
  --lr_scheduler="constant" --lr_warmup_steps=0 \
  --output_dir="sd-laion-art"
```
To LoRA-train:<br>
```python
export MODEL_NAME="segmind/small-sd"
export DATASET_NAME="fantasyfish/laion-art"

accelerate launch --mixed_precision="fp16" lora_training.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path=$MODEL_NAME \
  --dataset_name=$DATASET_NAME --caption_column="text" \
  --resolution=512 --random_flip \
  --train_batch_size=1 \
  --num_train_epochs=100 --checkpointing_steps=5000 \
  --learning_rate=1e-04 --lr_scheduler="constant" --lr_warmup_steps=0 \
  --seed=42 \
  --output_dir="fantasyfish/laion-art" \
  --validation_prompt="A man in a suit" --report_to="wandb"
  --use_peft \
  --lora_r=4 --lora_alpha=32 \
  --lora_text_encoder_r=4 --lora_text_encoder_alpha=32
```


The latter two scripts are taken from the [ðŸ¤— diffusers github](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).

## Advantages
+ Upto 100% Faster inferences
+ Upto 30% lower VRAM footprint
+ Faster dreambooth and LoRA training

## Limitations
+ The distilled models are in early phase and the outputs may not be at a production quality yet.
+ These models may not be the best general models. They are best used as fine-tuned or LoRA trained on specific concepts/styles.
+ Distilled models are not very good at composibility or multiconcepts yet.

## Research Roadmap
- [ ] SDXL distilled models and code.
- [ ] Further fine-tuned SD-1.5 base models for better composibility and generalization.
- [ ] Apply TensorRT and/or AITemplate for further accelerations.
- [ ] Look at Quantization-Aware-Training(QAT) during distillation process.
